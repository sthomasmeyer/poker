# POK3R NIGHTS

This application is designed to introduce users to the game of poker. It is an invaluable guide to both traditional and non-traditional variants: texas hold'em, pineapple, omaha hi-lo, seven card stud, midnight baseball, and criss cross.

## A One-paragraph History of Poker

In 1829, a group of degenerate French settlers brought the game of poker to New Orleans. From there it spread like wildfire, and quickly transformed itself from a dangerous game for outlaws to one embraced by the masses drawn to its elements of risk, competition, and consequence. It has drawn millions of viewers on live national television, and inspired blockbuster movies like Rounders (1989) and Molly's Game (2017). It is a game for everyone. A game for the average Joe playing with friends at a local bar, and a game for the billionaire playboy looking for an adrenaline rush. It is a game for you.

* **Objective**: make the best possible five card hand using any combination of the two cards in your hand plus the five community cards.
* **Set-up**: each player is dealt two cards, face down.
  * The player sitting directly to the left of the dealer must place a small blind bet, and the player sitting directly to their left must place a big blind bet.
* **First Round of Betting**: The player sitting directly to the left of the big blind has the opportunity to play first. They can either fold, call, or raise. Every other player will have the same three options. For each round of betting there is a maximum of one bet and three raises allowed.
* **The Flop**: After the first round of betting, the dealer will burn one card, and then place the next three face-up in the middle of the table. These are the first three community cards.
* **Second Round of Betting**: After the flop, the player sitting directly to the left of the dealer will have the opportunity to play first. They can either check, raise, or fold. Then, the other players who are still engaged in the hand will have an opportunity to check, call, raise, or fold. Remember, for each round of betting there is a maximum of one bet and three raises allowed.
* **The Turn**: After the second round of betting, the dealer will burn one card, and then place the next card face-up in the middle of the table. This is the fourth community card.

Remember, for each round of betting there is a maximum of one bet and three raises allowed.
* **The River**: After the third round of betting, the dealer will burn one card, and then place the next card face-up in the middle of the table. This is the fifth and final community card.
* **Final Round of Betting**: The player sitting directly to the left of the dealer will have the opportunity to play first. They can either check, raise, or fold. Then, the other players who are still engaged in the hand will have an opportunity to check, call, raise, or fold.
